This is a C# port of "Bantam". According to its README, bantam "is a tiny little Java app to demonstrate Pratt parsing. For a full explanation, see [this blog post](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/)."

When researching Pratt parsers, I found Bob Nystrom's blog post **Pratt Parsers: Expression Parsing Made Easy** (linked above) and thought it was one of the best articles on the subject. He uses Java for its examples and the complete program is in https://github.com/munificent/bantam. I decided to port the Java example to C# because that's the language I'll be using for my first Pratt-based parser.

The C# version here is pretty faithful to the original. I am not a Java expert so perhaps I introduced inadvertent changes; the last serious work I did in Java was in the last century. Also, I was influenced by another great article on the subject by Aleksey Kladov [Simple but Powerful Pratt Parsing](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html). In particular, I think Aleksey's use of "binding power" to describe and implement precedence simplifies the core concept and so I switched to that terminology when porting Bantam.
